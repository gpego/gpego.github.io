            <p>
                Wooden packaging makers often produce small batches of custom products.
                Each article has to be designed first, but most of these companies don't have the resources to create 
                a CAD model of each product since that is a time (and cost) consuming process.
                Therefore I'm currently working on a FreeCAD based software to 
                automate the design of wooden pallets and crates for a local company. 
                The software currently allows the user to customize an automatically generated 
                3D model simply by entering the specifications of the pallet/crate. 
                I'm now working to automatically generate the related 2D drawing as well.

                RoboCup is a global robotics competition with several specialties.
                Here you can see the fourth iteration of our robot. 
                I've been responsible for the mechanical 
                design and for part of the coding. I've developed 
                a program which had to find some balls using ML object detection and I've co-developed the line following software.
                <br />
                We developed the robot from scratch and learned a lot along the way. Not only we understood a 
                lot of concepts regarding robotics, we learned to how 
                to organize team-working and how to carry out successfully such a 
                complicated project as well.

                Developed in 2022 in the middle of what turned out to be the last 
                period of school from home caused by the pandemic. It was a small 
                3D printed stand for USB webcams controlled with a Telegram bot 
                that allowed us to tilt remotely the stand which was at school. It 
                was created to follow the teachers during lesson. Before that 
                teachers often had to adjust the camera manually to switch between 
                different areas of the blackboard. Luckily the recovery from the 
                pandemic started just before it was finished, so we decided to 
                complete the project anyway, but it has never been actually used 
                apart from some demonstartions.

                I've been part of the school team developing the software and the HMI 
                (Human-Machine Interface), a graphical interface for a small 
                industrial like assembly line.
                <br />
                This work will represent the school in the Omron Smart Project cup.
                <br />
                You can see the simulation of the HMI in the video above.

                I casually publish some 3D models on Prusa's Printables. If you 
                want you can check out my profile 
                <a href="https://www.printables.com/@gi0v1_05_82000">here</a>. 
                Unfortunately my prints are usually higly specific pieces 
                and so they're not published here.
