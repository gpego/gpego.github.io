                I'm currently working on a FreeCAD based software to

                This is the fourth iteration of our robot for the RoboCup Rescue 
                Line competition. Our team has been working on it for around a 
                year and a half. Given that we are just two team members, each one 
                has to work on various aspects. I'm responsible for the mechaical 
                design and for part of the coding. Specifically I'm in charge of 
                the development of a program which has to find some balls inside a 
                small room, using a ML object detection algorithm.
                <br />
                We started developing the robot from scratch and had the 
                opportunity to learn a lot along the way. Not only we understood a 
                lot of concepts regarding robotics, indeed we also learned to how 
                to organize team-working and how to carry out successfully such a 
                complicated projecy.

                Please note that this is just a web-developing excercise and 
                therefore the code is quite messy.

            <p>
                I've been part of the school team developing the software and the HMI 
                (Human-Machine Interface), a graphical interface for a small 
                industrial like assembly line.
                <br />
                This work will represent the school in the Omron Smart Project cup.
                <br />
                You can see the simulation of the HMI in the video above.

                I casually publish some 3D models on Prusa's Printables. If you 
                want you can check out my profile 
                <a href="https://www.printables.com/@gi0v1_05_82000">here</a>. 
                Unfortunately my prints are usually higly specific pieces 
                and so they're not published here.

                Developed in 2022 in the middle of what turned out to be the last 
                period of school from home caused by the pandemic. It was a small 
                3D printed stand for USB webcams controlled with a Telegram bot 
                that allowed us to tilt remotely the stand which was at school. It 
                was created to follow the teachers during lesson. Before that 
                teachers often had to adjust the camera manually to switch between 
                different areas of the blackboard. Luckily the recovery from the 
                pandemic started just before it was finished, so we decided to 
                complete the project anyway, but it has never been actually used 
                apart from some demonstartions.
